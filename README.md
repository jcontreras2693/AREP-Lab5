# Taller 5 | AREP

## Creation of a CRUD System to Manage Properties

In this project, we will develop a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing real estate properties. They will build a basic web application that enables users to perform key operations on property listings, finally the web application will be released in AWS.

## Project Summary

## Architecture

The architecture used aligns with the Client-Server pattern, in which a server hosts all resources, and one or more clients can access and use these resources through requests that are responded to by the Backend's REST services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/co/java/technologies/downloads/) 21 or higher.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). 3.8.1 o higher.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Latest
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Account
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional).
- Web Browser.

To check if installed, run:

```
java -version
```
```
mvn --version
```
```
docker --version
```
```
git --version
```

### Installing and Deployment

1. Download the repository from GitHub in a .zip or clone it to your local machine using Git.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jcontreras2693/AREP-Lab5.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```
    cd AREP-Lab5
    ```
   
3. Build the project by running the following command:

    ```
    mvn clean compile
    ```

4. Run MySQL on Docker with the next command:

    ```
    docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=properties_db -p 3306:3306 -d mysql
    ```

5. Run the application with this command:

   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. For local test access the address [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) from a web browser to interact with the web application.

7. Create the Docker image of the application:

    ```
    docker build --tag taller5arep .
    ```

7. Login and create the image on Dockerhub, the push the image:

    ```
    docker login
    docker tag taller5arep tu-usuario-docker/tu-repositorio-dockerhub
    docker push tu-usuario-docker/tu-repositorio-dockerhub
    ```

8. Run the application with this command:

   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

9. Finally, access the address [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) from a web browser to interact with the web application.

## Running the Tests

The tests performed verify the getters and setters of the Pok√©mon class, the PokemonController GET and POST actions and the Concurrency on PokemonServer.

To run the tests from the console, use the following command:

```
mvn test
```

If the tests were successful, you will see a message like this in your command console.
